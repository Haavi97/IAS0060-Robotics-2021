Coordinate converter
---------------
Node name: "coordinate_converter"

The node is used to convert between GPS coordinates and the metric coordinate
system used by localisation and navigation nodes. It sets the starting position
of the robot and the beacons and sets new navigation targets.

All degrees are fractions -- the digits after the period are fractions of a
degree, not arc minutes and seconds.

First thing the node does is set the locations of beacons to MotionEstimator
private parameters. For example, the following sets /ucat0/MotionEstimator/beacons
when used inside the coordinate_converter node tags in the launch file.

<rosparam param="beacons">
  beacon1: {latitude: 59.0, longitude: 23.0, depth: 1.05}
  beacon2: {latitude: 59.0, longitude: 23.0, depth: 1.05}
  beacon3: {latitude: 59.0, longitude: 23.0, depth: 1.05}
</rosparam>

Secondly, it sets the robot location as soon as MotionEstimator starts up. The
robot location is specified in the launch file as follows.

<rosparam param="input">
  latitude: 38.015775
  longitude: 12.506716
  depth: 0.0
</rosparam>

After beacons and robot position are set, the node will start to listen for
sensor_msgs/NavSatFix messages on "coordinates_input" topic. Each time a new
waypoint is received, the node calls the SetTarget service to send the robot
toward the waypoint.

Additionally, when sensor_msgs/NavSatFix messages arrive in "gps_input" topic,
the node sets robot position to the new coordinates, overwriting the initial
position.

The tool can be used on the command line to convert from GPS coordinates to
meters. The command for it is

rosrun tut_arrows coordinate_converter _input/latitude:=38.015775 _input/longitude:=12.506716 _input/depth:=1.0

After the metric coordinates are printed on the screen, terminate the node with
Ctrl+C.
